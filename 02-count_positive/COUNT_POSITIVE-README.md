# Count Positives Until Zero

This program will keep asking the user to enter a number until they enter `0`. At the end, it should print how many **positive numbers** were entered.

You do **not** need to store the numbers â€” just **count** how many were positive (greater than 0).

### Example Run

```

Enter a number: -1
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 0
You entered 2 positive number(s).

```

### Requirements

- Use a `while` loop
- Input ends when the user types `0`
- Track only numbers **greater than 0**
- Ignore negative numbers and `0` in the count
