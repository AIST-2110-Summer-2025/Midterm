# Assignment 9: While Loops

This week, you'll be delving into the `while` loop construct to practice with
indefinite (and infinite) looping. Looping is one of the most fundamental
control structures in any programming language. It is simple in concept, but
often difficult to put into practice effectively. We're focusing on a few useful
patterns of use to start with.

## Learning Objectives

1. Learn the basic structure of a `while` loop.
2. Prctice using `while` loops for:
   - Input validation
   - Counter controlled loops
   - Accumulating values
3. Learn the early break and early continue strategies.

## Assignment Structure

The assignment is structured into the following exercise folders under the root
folder `assn-9-yourusername/`:

- `01-get_int`
- `02-blastoff`
- `03-guess`
- `04-stats`

Each folder contains specific tasks that you need to complete.

## Assignment Completion Procedures

You will complete and submit this assignment in a similar way to prior
assignments. To avoid cluttering up this README with the same instructions each
time, they have been broken out into a separate file. Please reference
[PROCEDURES.md](PROCEDURES.md) to see the details if you have forgotten.

In summary:

  1. Complete the code for each exercise per the instructions
  2. Run the scripts to test and debug
  3. Execute the automated tests to ensure expected functionality

When finished, do not forget to:

1. Commit and Sync:
    - Switch to version control tab
    - Stage all changed files
    - _**Enter a commit message**_
    - Click Commit
    - Click Sync
2. Validate your submission in GitHub
3. Submit the final commit ID in D2L
