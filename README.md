# Midterm Practical: Input Validation and Loop Control

This midterm will test your understanding of **user input**, **boolean logic**, and **loop control** using `while` loops. These are fundamental patterns in Python programming and critical for building reliable, user-facing programs.

## Learning Objectives

1. Practice the structure and execution of `while` loops
2. Use `while` loops for:
   - Input validation
   - Sentinel-controlled input
   - Conditional checks and accumulation
3. Return meaningful values from user-defined functions
4. Strengthen your ability to debug and test with provided files

## Midterm Structure

The midterm consists of two coding problems. Each problem lives in its own subdirectory inside your root folder (named `midterm-yourusername/`). You are required to complete the `.py` file in each folder and use the provided test files to verify correctness.

- `01-get_yes_no`  
  Build a function that repeatedly prompts the user for a `'yes'` or `'no'` response until a valid answer is given.

- `02-count_positive`  
  Count how many positive numbers a user enters until they type `0`, and then print the result.

Each folder contains:

- A starter Python script (`.py`)
- A markdown README file with instructions
- A `tests/` folder containing a test file for validating your solution

## Midterm Completion Procedures

You should complete and submit this midterm the same way as prior assignments. For full details, refer to the [PROCEDURES.md](PROCEDURES.md) file.

**In summary:**

1. Complete the code for each exercise as described in the respective README
2. Run your script and use the test file inside `tests/` to ensure correct behavior
3. When finished, commit and sync your work

### Submission Checklist:

1. ✅ Implement solutions for both exercises  
2. ✅ Run and pass the provided tests  
3. ✅ Use version control to:
   - Stage all changed files
   - Enter a commit message
   - Commit and sync
4. ✅ Confirm your submission is visible on GitHub
5. ✅ Submit the final commit ID in D2L

Good luck — and don’t forget to read error messages carefully!
